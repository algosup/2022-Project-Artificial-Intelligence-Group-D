## 1. Introduction

### a. Overview 

The entire of this project must be done in **Python 3.9.12**. We hace decided to use this version and not the latest because we use differents libraries like **TensorFlow** or **Numpy** and this allows us to avoid potential problems.

### b. Glossary

| terms | definitions |
|-|-|
| AI | Artificial Intelligence |
| DL | Deep Learning : It was created by drawing inspiration from the neural networks found in the human brain, which means that deep learning is made up of a large number of layers of interconnected artificial neurons, hence the name "deep learning". |

### c. Product and Technical Requirements

| Technical | Using |
|-|-|
|[Python](https://www.python.org/) | We code with Python is the best language in order to create a machine learning. | 
|[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) | TensorFlow is a library for running machine learning and deep learning applications.|
|[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) | NumPy is an essential library that allows us to create array tables to organize our data. |
